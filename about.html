It also strengthens skills for matching pitches to corresponding notes in musical notation. These are crucial skills for anyone looking to become stronger in musical understanding and theory. Training mode uses a piano labeled with musical notes to create associations between notes and pitches. Quiz mode puts these skills to the test by playing a random pitch and allowing the player to decide which note it represents. Have fun!</h4></div>
